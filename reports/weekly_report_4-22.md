# Weekly Status Report
### Team Report
**Progress/Issues:**
- As a team we created an outline for the Requirements doc. Once we created a rough outline we split the sections among the group to fill them in. We were able to split up the work so that noone felt overloaded, but did face some confusion in individual sections about who was responsible for what, as we have not solidified the projects architecture. These issues were easily solve once we reconvened as a group to solidify the final document.
- We finished the team policies document. We had no issues with this, and were able to establish what components each of use felt comfortable working in with relative ease, and what methods of communication worked best for us moving forward.
- We set up our git repo that we will be using to develop the project. No issues with git setup.

**Plans/Goals:**
- Talk to Kaushal to see if our project has been properly rescoped, and if not, figure our how to properly rescope it. (Thursday)
- Design the architecture for the project.
- Create a development plan for implementing the architecture we design.
    - Individual subgroups (backend, databases, frontend) will devise their own strategies to tackle their component(s).
    - Discuss as a group how these components will work together to produce our desired end product given the use cases we have established.
    - Beyond next week: begin development for a minimum viable product.

### Individual Contributions
**Aleksa Milovanovic:**
- In requirements doc: Made the process description after a large amount of brainstorming for the group. Created a use case and the preliminary schedule moving forward.
- Goals for coming week: Devoting more time to the team, figuring out how we'll be structuring meetings (have an agenda for each), and focus on learning the system architecture and how it all works together.

**Julia Kalmykov:**
- In requirements doc: Added use cases, worked on the functional requirements section, helped the group brainstorm other sections from the requirements doc.
- Goals for coming week: Understand how the components work together and what my responsibilities are in the system.

**Mitchell Wong:**
- In requirements doc: Completed the non-functional requirements section, added a use case, and helped the group brainstorm the requirements doc.
- Goals for coming week: Figure out what needs to happen in the backend (how tasks will be divided and handled). Longer term goals: figure out how my code will interact with the database and the front end.

**Kyle Johnson:**
- In requirements doc: Fleshed out Product Description and added a use case after larger group brainstorm for requirements doc.
- Goals for coming week: Solidify framework for frontend. Figure out how frontend and backend/database components will interact. Create a rough design sketch for frontend and a timeline for implementation.

**Michael Figgs:**
- In requirements doc: Added a use case, helped brainstorm other sections, proofread and formatted parts of the doc.
- Goals for coming week: Get workspace all set up. Discuss architecture with group and write specifications for the backend.
