Not a bug but needed change:
    Make list of ingredients on the front end more general, instead of chicken breast, chicken tenders
    replace with just chicken


Database:
    GetUserProfile: UserProfile created in wrong order, diet and health switched.
    Several equals() methods required for proper checking if two objects were equal were not implemented.
    Date and String conversion in Pantry wasn't 100%, some issues with months and years.
    "Cannot read property 'ingredients' of null" error when running frontend with a newly spun up database
    
Frontend:
    Opening/closing the date picker and interacting with it causes the ingredient to be checked/unchecked
    No recipes found no matter how many ingredients added to pantry
